Numbers are ALWAYS little-endian
Note that NitroFS is an OSDI partition type and requires OSDI. The partition type is Nitro_FS

Default Logical Sector Size (SS): 512
Default Logical Sector Offset (SO): 8
Content Address (CA) -> Physical Address: CA * SS + SO

At filesystem start:
NTRFS1 - 6 bytes
[DIR] - CA pointing to root directory - 2 bytes - The CA by default equals 0, but is changeable
Total MFSR size: 8 bytes

Directory Entry [DIR]:
D = Directory - 1 byte
SIZE - 2 bytes - size (in bytes) of this directory entry
PARENT - 2 bytes (logical sector number of parent, from 0 to 65535)
NAME - 32 bytes, note: this is not the path, the path is calculated from PARENT, the string is terminated with \0
NUMBER OF CHILDRENS - unsigned short
CHILDRENS (ID + SECTOR) - 3 bytes (1 for ID, 2 for SECTOR) (ID = `D` for directory and ID = `F` for file)
Childrens entry max length: 474 (or 158 childrens per directory)
Size of empty directory: 133

File Entry [FILE]:
F = File - 1 byte
SIZE - 2 bytes - size (in bytes) of this file's fragment
PARENT - 2 bytes - parent of this file (must be a directory)
NAME - 32 bytes
TEXT FRAGMENT - 474 bytes
NEXT - 2 bytes - next sector of file entry (with different fragment), equals to 0 if file done
