# NitroFS
Numbers are ALWAYS little-endian

Note that NitroFS requires OSDI and partition type is Nitro_FS

## Sizes and Computations
- Default Logical Sector Size (SS): 512
- Default Logical Sector Offset (SO): 8
- Content Address (CA) -> Physical Address: CA * SS + SO

## Head structure
- NTRFS1 - 6 bytes
- [DIR] - CA pointing to root directory - 2 bytes - The CA by default equals 0, but is changeable
- Total MFSR size: 8 bytes

## Filesystem Structure

### Directory Entry
- D = Directory - 1 byte
- PADDING - 2 bytes - used for easier integration with file entry
- PARENT - 2 bytes (logical sector number of parent, from 0 to 65535)
- NAME - 32 bytes, note: this is not the path, the path is calculated from PARENT, the string is terminated with \0
- NUMBER OF CHILDRENS - unsigned short
- CHILDRENS (TYPE + CA) - 3 bytes (1 for TYPE, 2 for CA) (TYPE = `D` for directory and TYPE = `F` for file)
- Childrens entry max length: 474 (or 158 childrens per directory)
Used space of empty directory: 133

An equivalent as C structure would be:
```c
struct ChildrenEntry {
	unsigned char type;
	unsigned short address;
};

struct DirectoryEntry {
	unsigned char type = 'D'; // always ASCII 'D'
	unsigned short size;
	unsigned short parent;
	unsigned char* name; // of length 32
	unsigned short childrens;
	ChildrenEntry* entries;
};
```

### File Entry
- F = File - 1 byte
- SIZE - 2 bytes - size (in bytes) of this file
- PARENT - 2 bytes - parent of this file (must be a directory)
- NAME - 32 bytes
- Attribute - 1 byte
- FRAGMENT - 2 bytes - the first fragment of the file, equals to 0 if file is empty

And as a C structure it would again give:
```c
struct FileEntry {
	unsigned char type = 'F'; // always ASCII 'F'
	unsigned short size;
	unsigned short parent;
	unsigned char* name; // of length 32
	unsigned char attributes;
	unsigned short fragment;
};
```

### Fragment Entry
- R = fRagment - 1 byte
- NEXT - 2 bytes - next fragment of the file, equals to 0 if file done
- TEXT FRAGMENT - 509 bytes

Finally, it's C structure would be:
```c
struct FragmentEntry {
	unsigned char type = 'R'; // always ASCII 'R'
	unsigned short next;
	char* text; // of length 509
};
```
